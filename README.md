# TIC TAC C 

Hello, the following program is intended to be a terminal application 
Written purely in C in which you can play tic tac toe. 

The purpose of this project is 2-fold. 

1. I want to actually code something in C, I am tired of taking copying code at this point. 

2. Getting used to reading up tech documents and making consistent commits. 

Tic Tac Toe is simply the first project I ever wrote in python that I felt I accomplished something (Full 2 player mode, match history and AI)
So now I'd like to redo it in C, consider it a hello world-esque project. 

The features I'd like to add are as follows:
---

- An AI with 3 difficulties (Easy, Medium, Impossible)

- A 2 player LAN mode (VS)

- An application window

- Network Leaderboards 



### The first steps 
---
 
The goal initially is going to be setting up the board and creating the repo. 

After that, I will set up the pop up window instead of it just being stuck in the terminal. 

After _THAT_ I will look into expanding it.
